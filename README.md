# H-Bridge Driver for 3.3V PWM Input (HI/LO)

This project is a discrete transistor-based H-bridge driver designed to drive loads such as a bi-directional LED string (NOT motors, you *need* to use protection diodes in that case!) using two 3.3V logic-level PWM inputs.

## Overview

The circuit takes two complementary (non-overlapping) PWM inputs: `HI_IN` and `LO_IN`, each at 3.3V logic level. These signals are level-shifted and drive a discrete H-bridge output stage composed of NPN and PNP BJTs. The output connects to a load (e.g., LED strip) in a push-pull fashion.

## Inputs

- `HI_IN`: 3.3V logic PWM input (controls left-side NPN-PNP transistors)
- `LO_IN`: 3.3V logic PWM input (controls right-side NPN-PNP transistors)

⚠️ **Important:**  
`HI_IN` and `LO_IN` **must be phase-shifted**, even though the NPN-PNP-pair makes sure shoot-through is impossible. If both are high simultaneously, the output is off.

## Supply

- `+5V`: Power rail for the H-bridge (used to drive the load)
- `GND`: Common ground

## Outputs

- `O1`, `O2`: Differential outputs to the load

## Notes

- Input resistors and capacitors are used for filtering and protection.
- BJTs are used in complementary pairs (NPN/PNP) for each half-bridge.
- I have not yet tested how much current this schematic can tolerate (depending on transistors and thermal limits).
- Load: connected between `O1` and `O2` (e.g., antiparallel LEDs)
- You can use [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) to drive the inputs - select "PWM CCT" as LED-type. For the phase-shifted PWM to work, you might need to use a beta version from [wled-install.github.io](https://wled-install.github.io/) - 0.16 nightly worked for me.  
- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) works as well, see example below

```yaml
output:
  - platform: ledc
    id: pwm_hi
    pin: 3
    frequency: 5kHz
    inverted: false
    phase_angle: 0.0

  - platform: ledc
    id: pwm_lo
    pin: 4
    frequency: 5kHz
    inverted: false
    phase_angle: 180.0

  - platform: template
    id: pwm_bridge
    type: float
    write_action:
      lambda: |-
        float duty = clamp(state, 0.0f, 1.0f) * 0.5f;
        id(pwm_hi).set_level(duty);
        id(pwm_lo).set_level(duty);
        ESP_LOGD("custom", "H-Bridge Control: HI=%.2f LO=%.2f", duty, duty);

## Simulation

![H-Bridge Simulation](images/h-bridge-simulation.png)
You can use KiCad's simulation tool to simulate the behaviour of this schematic. Modify the parameters of V1 and V2 to simulate different PWM patterns.

## Gerber files

You can download the gerber file directory as a zipfile and directly upload it to e.g. https://aisler.net, https://jlcpcb.com or https://pcbway.com
